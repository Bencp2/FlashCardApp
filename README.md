Priority descending

1. Allow user to change order of cards in deck from card menu
    Reasoning: Provides the user the ability to study the cards in the order they choose 

2. 

3. Create button in study page that allows user to redo a flash card instead of only being able to reshuffle or having to move to the next or previous card to reset.

4. Add feature that resets id increments of both decks and cards back to 0 when last deck is deleted and resets the id increment of cards back to 0 when the last card is deleted.

5. Add comments to help other understand code
    Reasoning: To make the code more understandable to others and myself if I ever take a long break

6. Change cursor executions to become more protected from SQL injection by writting them in a more secure way.
